# Script: rman_yearly_stable_cold_fullbu_cdb1.sh
# Purpose: Executes a stable YEARLY COLD (offline) full compressed database backup
#          for the cdb1 container database (CDB), protected by the KEEP clause.
# Execution: Scheduled via cron yearly (e.g., on Jan 1st).
# DISADVANTAGE: Requires downtime during the backup process.
